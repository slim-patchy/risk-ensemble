# risk-ensemble
A repo to test some AI hypothesis on credit risk modelling

## Some basic ML models that will be investigated
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. Naïve Bayes
4. Random Rorests
5. XGBoost (which is a form of Gradient Boosting)
6. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
7. Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
8. LASSO (for refining our feature engineering)
